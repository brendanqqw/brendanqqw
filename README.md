### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Brendan Raul Degrano, an aspiring BS Information Technology student hailing from St. Paul University Surigao in the scenic Philippines. My coding journey has been shaped by a deep fascination with web development, where I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and PHP. Crafting responsive, captivating web experiences is my forte, whether it involves designing elegant front-end interfaces or building robust back-end systems. Beyond web development, my toolkit spans various languages and skills, including VB.NET for desktop applications, Python Flask for web apps, and a budding interest in cybersecurity, with a focus on penetration testing using Kali Linux. Mobile app development and Bash scripting have also found their way into my repertoire. Away from the screen, I'm an avid movie enthusiast, pondering philosophical questions, and appreciating the expressive realms of music and the arts. Currently pursuing my BSIT degree at St. Paul University Surigao, I'm always exploring fresh ideas and technologies. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
